These plans might be deterministic or split mass : we show that the first measure can be decomposed in d+1 parts, each allowing (martingale) optimal plans to split mass in a fixed number of directions, from 0 to d. In addition, the directions of splitting are orthogonal to some sets over which the measure is concentrated, each being covered by c-c hypersurfaces of a fixed dimension.</div>

This talk provides the generalization of this result to any measure with finite second moment : given a measure, we identify d+1 sets behaving as k-dimensional DC manifolds, and show that if an optimal transport plan with first marginal mu is, additionally, a martingale plan, then it must be concentrated on the normal directions to these sets. A converse is given if one allows the plans to be merely tangent, i.e. limits of optimal plans in L2(mu).</div>

The red wire is the control of a population of drivers in a traffic network. At first, we focus on a single driver, addressing the difficulty of the lack of regularity of the ambient space. We propose a framework for Cauchy-Lipschitz control problems in CAT(0) spaces, in which we are able to give sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal control, and characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Secondly, we consider a probability measure evolving on the Euclidean space, representing a population of drivers. We obtain a comparison principle that is applicable to the control of such a population, that we prove in more generality in spaces with curvature bounded from below. Thirdly, we provide a first step towards the treatment of populations evolving on networks, by proving that the squared Wasserstein distance over a network is directionally differentiable. In formulating the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the Wasserstein space using solely the metric structure, one needs some technical argument to use continuity equations as characteristics; this is developed in a last chapter, focussing in more details about the geometry induced by optimal transport on measures.</div>

Extensions to the L² setting are known since the early 1960’s, and rely on the Hilbertian geometry of vector fields. This poster presents an extension of these results whenever the f to be decomposed is no longer a vector field, but a measure field, i.e. may give a probability to different vectors at each point. The recent development of the Wasserstein geometry provides the correct generalization of the L² setting. It is shown that any measure fields decomposes in an unique way in two components that are orthogonal in some sense, and support the same gradient/divergence-free interpretation. However, some properties are lost with respect to the vector field setting: to a pair (g,h) might correspond several f, and Pythagoras fails.</div>

We present one of such extensions, namely the characterization of the value function of a control problem as the minimal viscosity supersolution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</div>

Our aim is to write a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation whose unique solution is the value function of the control problem. This type of problem usually admits nonsmooth solutions, and is treated with the theory of viscosity solutions [Crandall-Lions 1992]. <br>
            To extend the theory of viscosity solutions to <math>&Pscr;<sub>2</sub>(&Ropf;<sup>d</sup>)</math>, several lines of investigation are open. One can use semidifferentials [Marigonda-Quincampoix 2018, Gangbo-Tudorascu 2019] or implement metric viscosity techniques in the case of Eikonal-type equations [Ambrosio-Feng 2014, Giga-Hakamuri-Nakasayu 2015]. In this talk, we follow an idea raised in [Jerhaoui 2022] and consider instead the map of directional derivatives as our elementary local approximation of a smooth function, instead of a gradient. This framework allow to define viscosity solutions using quite natural test functions, and supports a strong comparison principle while retaining the link between Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and control problems. We are interested in understanding in which case can we extend the natural equivalence between semidifferentials and test function definition, that stands in the finite-dimensional setting.</div>

Modulo adjustments to cope with the absence of local compactness, our definition is then very similar to the finite-dimensional case. We show that such a viscosity notion supports a strong comparison principle, and that the value function of the control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated to the control problem. This work follows and generalizes [JeanJerhaouiZidani2022], in which the underlying space is a compact manifold and the dynamic is independant of the measure. Additionally, we are able to consider weaker regularity on the terminal cost and the dynamic, and we take care to only use arguments relying on the geometry of the general tangent cone.</div>

In particular, for sufficiently regular dynamics, the trajectories enjoy a nice representation as the pushforward through the semigroup of the underlying ODE. On the other hand, control problems are naturally linked to the viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. Our aim is to contribute to the extension of the viscosity theory over the Wasserstein space. We explore the choice of a particular set of test functions, including the squared distance, that allows us to obtain a weak comparison principle and verify that the value function of the control problem is the unique Lipschitz and bounded solution of the corresponding HJ equation.

            <div id="slidesQITNS" class="abstract" onclick="toggleVisibility('slidesQITNS')">The generalization of viscosity theory to control problems over Wasserstein space is an active topic. This talk will focus on some advances in the direction of test functions. We introduce the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to control problems in a general context in order to highlight the intuition behind it, then decline it in the Wasserstein context. We discuss how to overcome two of the arising difficulties by adapting the notion of viscosity. This allows us to obtain some results of comparison and uniqueness of the solution of a suitable HJ equation.</div>

The family of Ekeland principles adresses the question "what can we say when there is no minimum?" This talk will present the original principle and some variants in an elementary fashion, with hope to highlight the power of this elegant theory.</div>

            <div id="slidesEik" class="abstract" onclick="toggleVisibility('slidesEik')">In its simplest form, the eikonal equation reads |u’| = 1. The right notion of solution seems to be viscosity solutions, that are, in a sense, maximal. This remark opens on an analytical method of resolution very close to the spectral decomposition of linear operators, and highlights the deep connection between viscosity and control problems.</div>
