Extensions to the L² setting are known since the early 1960’s, and rely on the Hilbertian geometry of vector fields. This poster presents an extension of these results whenever the f to be decomposed is no longer a vector field, but a measure field, i.e. may give a probability to different vectors at each point. The recent development of the Wasserstein geometry provides the correct generalization of the L² setting. It is shown that any measure fields decomposes in an unique way in two components that are orthogonal in some sense, and support the same gradient/divergence-free interpretation. However, some properties are lost with respect to the vector field setting: to a pair (g,h) might correspond several f, and Pythagoras fails.</div>

We present one of such extensions, namely the characterization of the value function of a control problem as the minimal viscosity supersolution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</div>

Our aim is to write a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation whose unique solution is the value function of the control problem. This type of problem usually admits nonsmooth solutions, and is treated with the theory of viscosity solutions [Crandall-Lions 1992]. <br>
            To extend the theory of viscosity solutions to <math>&Pscr;<sub>2</sub>(&Ropf;<sup>d</sup>)</math>, several lines of investigation are open. One can use semidifferentials [Marigonda-Quincampoix 2018, Gangbo-Tudorascu 2019] or implement metric viscosity techniques in the case of Eikonal-type equations [Ambrosio-Feng 2014, Giga-Hakamuri-Nakasayu 2015]. In this talk, we follow an idea raised in [Jerhaoui 2022] and consider instead the map of directional derivatives as our elementary local approximation of a smooth function, instead of a gradient. This framework allow to define viscosity solutions using quite natural test functions, and supports a strong comparison principle while retaining the link between Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and control problems. We are interested in understanding in which case can we extend the natural equivalence between semidifferentials and test function definition, that stands in the finite-dimensional setting.</div>

The key idea is to avoid the definition of a gradient of applications going from <math>&Pscr;<sub>2</sub>(&Ropf;<sup>d</sup>)</math> to <math>&Ropf;<sup>d</sup></math>, by working directly with directional derivatives. Modulo adjustments to cope with the absence of local compactness, our definition is then very similar to the finite-dimensional case. We show that such a viscosity notion supports a strong comparison principle, and that the value function of the control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated to the control problem. This work follows and generalizes [JeanJerhaouiZidani2022], in which the underlying space is a compact manifold and the dynamic is independant of the measure. Additionally, we are able to consider weaker regularity on the terminal cost and the dynamic, and we take care to only use arguments relying on the geometry of the general tangent cone.</div>

On the one hand, there is now a stable theory of absolutely continuous curves of measures, characterized as the solutions of the continuity equation. In particular, for sufficiently regular dynamics, the trajectories enjoy a nice representation as the pushforward through the semigroup of the underlying ODE. On the other hand, control problems are naturally linked to the viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. Our aim is to contribute to the extension of the viscosity theory over the Wasserstein space. We explore the choice of a particular set of test functions, including the squared distance, that allows us to obtain a weak comparison principle and verify that the value function of the control problem is the unique Lipschitz and bounded solution of the corresponding HJ equation. In addition, this choice bears strong links with subdifferential notions of the literature.</div>
